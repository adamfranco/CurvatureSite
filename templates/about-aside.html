  <h2>About Curvature</h2>
  <p>Curvature files are created by analyzing the geometry of highways in the <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> data-set to detect curves and ranking each segment based on how many curves there are. The highways are then filtered to include only the most twisty segments in the output. Additional filtering is done to exclude segments marked with surface tags that indicate that they are unpaved. The resulting highways are combined into color-coded <code>KML</code>/<code>KMZ</code> files that can be opened in <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/">GoogleEarth</a> or other programs for viewing.</p>
