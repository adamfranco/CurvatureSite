  <h2>Improving the Data</h2>

  <p>Because Curvature uses the <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> -- a world-map that anyone can edit -- as its data source, you too can improve the map and thereby improve the Curvature files the next time they are generated. For more information about improvements that are of particular help to Curvature, please see the <a href="https://roadcurvature.com/how-it-works/osm/">Curvature OpenStreetMap</a> page.</p>
